# ColorApp

This is an app created for the Mobile Development class at Temple University for the Fall 2017 semester.

This app uses fragments to display a list of pre-decided colors. The user can select any of the colors and this will result in a new fragment being launched that will have a background color as the selected color.

This app displays the fragments in two ways depending on either the orientation or size of the device:
- If it is a small device in portrait mode it will display only one pane and the new fragment will be launched over the old one.
- If it is either a small device in landscape mode or a large device in either landscape or portrait mode it will display two panes. One pane will have the list of colors and the second pane will display the selected color.
